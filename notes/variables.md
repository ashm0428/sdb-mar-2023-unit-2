# Variables

Variables are used to store and to point to things in memory. So we are able to reference it later on in the script.

EX: Algebra
```js
x = 15

x + 5 = ? //20

```

In JS all variables must have `unique name`. 

### Rules for Naming
- Names can contain letters, numbers, underscores, and dollar signs
- Names SHOULD begin with a letter
- Names can begin with a dollar sign or an underscore (but not really used)
- Names are case sensitive (x and X they are different)
- Reserve words CANNOT be used (class, let, const, var, etc) - protected words
